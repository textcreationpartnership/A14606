            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to aggrauate the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the liuing in the ſhame of the dead, but to diſſwade the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly blinded, from ſeeking their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in the way to damnation, I
<pb facs="tcp:6625:5"/>haue here briefely ſet downe a diſcourſe of the behauiour and cariage of the eight perſons afore named, from the time of their impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the inſtant of their death: the nature of their offence, the little ſhew of their ſorrow; their vſage in priſon, and their obſtinacie to their end. Firſt, for their offence, it is odious in the eares of all humaine Creatures, that it could hardlie be belieued, that ſo many monſters in nature, ſhoulde carry the ſhapes of men: Murther, oh, it is the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne of the world, and ſuch an inten ded Murther, as had it taken effect, would haue made a worlde to crie; and therefore the horror thereof, muſt needes bee hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the whole world to heare of it.</p>
            <p>Men that ſaw them goe to their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; did in a ſorte grieue, to ſee ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per men in ſhape, goe to ſo ſhamefull an end, but the end was proper to men of ſo vnproper minds, who to ſatisfie ablinded conceite, would forget their duties to God and their King, and vnnaturally
<pb facs="tcp:6625:5"/>ſeeke the ruine of their Natiue Countrie: They are ſaid to be borne vnhappie, that are not ſome way profitable to their Countrie, and then, hovv accurſed are they borne, that ſeeke the deſtruction of the whole Kingdome?</p>
            <p>Papiſtes will perhaps idlely ſay, it was a bloody execution, but in reſpect of their deſert, in the blood they entended to haue ſhedde, it was a mercifull puniſhment; For if <hi>Iezabel</hi> a Queen for ſeeking the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one priuate man, was throwne out of a window, and fedde vppon by dogs: How can theſe people bee thought to be cruelly vſed, that could entend and practiſe ſo horrible a villany, as the death of ſo gracious a King, Queene and Prince, ſo Noble Peeres, &amp; the ruine of ſo flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But ſince my entent is chieflie to make report of the manner of their demeanors from the priſon to the Arraignement, &amp; from thence to Execution. I will truely ſet downe, what I haue gathered, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:6625:6"/>the ſame. After their apprehenſion in the Countrie, and brought vp to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, vpon the Apparance of their foule treaſon, before his Maieſties moſt Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Councell, they were by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement committed to his Maieſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Tower of London, where they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, that in the mercy of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prince, was thought fit, and indeed too good for ſo vnchriſtian offenders. For in the time of their impriſonment they ſeemed to feele no part of feare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the wrath of God, the doome of Iuſtice, or the ſhame of ſinne; but as it were, with ſeared Conſciences, ſenceles of grace, liued, as not looking to die, or not feeling the ſorrow of their ſinnes; and now that no ſubtill Foxe, or rather Gooſe, that would faine ſeame a Foxe, ſhall haue cauſe, to ſay or thinke, that the Iuſtice of the lawe hath not beene truely miniſtred, according to the rules of the diuine will, hehold here a true report, as I ſaid before of their behauiour, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb facs="tcp:6625:6"/>from their apprehenſion, to their impriſonment, and from condemnation to their execution. In the time of their impriſonment, they rather feaſted with their ſinnes, then faſted with ſorrow for them; were richly apparrelled, fared deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and tooke Tabacco out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with a ſeeming careleſneſſe of their crime, as it were daring the Law to paſſe vppon them: but, the Almightie, and our moſt mercifull good God firſt reuealed them. His Maieſties and his Counſailes carefull head apprehended them, the law plainely did diſcipher them, Iuſtice gaue iudgement on them, and death made an end of them: but to come to their Araign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to deliuer the manner of their behauiour, after they went from the Tower by water &amp; come to Weſtminſter before they came into the hall, they made ſome halfe howres ſtay, or more in the Star chamber, whether being brought, and remaining til the Court was all ready to heare them, and according to the lawe to
<pb facs="tcp:6625:7"/>giue iudgement on them, it was ſtrange to note their carriage euen in their verie countenances: Some hanging downe the heade, as if their heartes were full of doggednes, and other forcing a ſterne looke, as if they would feare death, with a frowne, neuer ſeeming to pray, except it were by the dozen, vpon their beades, and taking Tabacco, as if that hanging were no trouble to them; ſaying little but in commendation of their concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted religion, crauing mercy of neyther God nor the king for their offences, and making their Conſciences, as it were as wide as the worlde; and to the verie gates of Hell, to be the cauſe of their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh courſes to make a worke merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>Now being come into the hall, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſcaffold at the barre ſtanding to aunſwere to their Inditements, They all pleaded not guiltie, but were all found guiltie, <hi>Digby</hi> without crauing mercie, or fauour, of either God, or the King made
<pb facs="tcp:6625:7"/>onely fiue worldly requeſts, that his wife might haue her lointer, his children the lands intailed, by his father; his ſiſters their legafies in his hand vnpaid, his debts paide, and for his death, to bee behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not hanged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Winter</hi> in like manner thinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe alreadie halfe a Saint for his whole villanie, ſaide little to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that eyther made ſhew of ſorrow, or ſought mercy, but onely made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the king for mercy towardes his Brother, in regarde of his offence as he ſaide, thorough his onely perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>His brother ſayed little, but with a guiltie conſcience, ſvvallovved vp a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed griefe, with little ſhevv of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Graunt</hi> ſtubborne in his idolatrie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing penitent for his villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, asked little mercy, but as it vvere
<pb facs="tcp:6625:8"/>careles of grace receiued the doome of his deſert.</p>
            <p>The yonger <hi>Winter</hi> ſaide little, but to excuſe the fovvlenes of his fact, in being dravvne in by his brother, and not of his ovvne plotting, vvith little talke to litile purpoſe troubled the time the leſſer vvhile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruckwood</hi> out of a ſtudied ſpeech vvould faine haue made his bringing vppe and breeding in idolatrie, to haue beene ſome excuſe to his villanie, but a faire talke, could not helpe a fovvle deed, and therefore being found guiltie of the treaſon, had his iudgement vvith the reſt of the traytors.</p>
            <p>Novv after their condemnation and iudgement, being ſent backe to the Tovver, there they remayned till the Thurſeday following; vpon ſleddes and hurdles they were drawne into Powles Churchyearde; Fowre of them, vz. <hi>Euerarde Digble,</hi> the elder <hi>Winter, Graunt,</hi> and <hi>Bates,</hi> of whome I forgat to ſpeake,
<pb facs="tcp:6625:8"/>hauing no great matter to ſpeake of, but onely that being a villanie, and hoping of aduancement by the ſame, he had the rewarde of a traytor.</p>
            <p>Now theſe foure being drawne to the Scaffolde, made one purpoſe for their execution: Firſt went vp <hi>Digbie</hi> a man of a goodly perſonage, and a manly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, yet might a warie Eye in the change of his countenaunce, beholde an inwarde feare of death, for his colour grew pale and his eie heauie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that hee enforced him ſelfe, to ſpeake as ſtoutly as hee could, his ſpeech, was not long and to little good purpoſe onely that his belied conſcience, being but indeed a blinded conceit, had led him into this offence, which in reſpect of his religion <hi>alias</hi> in deede Idolatrie, hee held no offence but in reſpect of the law he held an offence for vvhich, hee aſked forgiueneſſe of God, of the king, and the vvhole kingdome, and ſo vvith vaine, and ſuperſtitious croſſing of himſelfe betook
<pb facs="tcp:6625:9"/>him to his Latine prayers, mumbling to him ſelfe, refuſing to haue any prayers of any, but of the Romiſh Catholicks, vvent vp the Ladder and vvith the helpe of the hangman made an end of his vvicked daies in this vvorld.</p>
            <p>After him vvent <hi>Winter,</hi> vp to the Scaffold vvhére he vſed fevv vvords to anie good effect, vvithout aſking mercie of either God or the king for his offence, went vp the ladder, and making a few prayers to himſelfe, ſtaide not long for his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
            <p>After him went <hi>Graunt,</hi> who abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably blinded with his horrible ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, though he confeſſed his offence to bee hainous, yet would faine haue excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it by his conſcience, for Religion: a bloodie religion, to make ſo bloody a conſcience: but better that his bloode and all ſuch as hee was, ſhould bee ſhed by the iuſtice of law, then the bloode of many thouſandes to have beene ſhedde by his villanie, without lawe or iuſtice:
<pb facs="tcp:6625:9"/>but to the purpoſe, hauing vſed a fevve i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wordes to ill effect, hee was as his Fellowes before him, ledde the way to the Halter: and ſo after his croſſing of himſelfe, to the laſt parte of his tragedie.</p>
            <p>Laſt of them came <hi>Bates,</hi> who ſeemed ſorie for his offence, and asked forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and the king, and of the whole kingdome, prayed to God for the preſeruation of them all, and as hee ſayed, onely for his loue to his Maiſter, drawne to forget his duety to God, his king and Countrie, and therefore was now drawne from the Tower to Paules Churchyeard, and there hanged &amp; quartered for his treacherie. Thus ended that dayes buſines.</p>
            <p>The next day being Friday, were drawne from the Tower to the old Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in VVeſtminſter, ouer againſt the Parliament houſe, <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> theyon ger brother, <hi>Ruckewoode, Cayes</hi> &amp; <hi>Faulks</hi> the Miner, iuſtly called the Deuill of the Vault: for had hee not beene a Deuill
<pb facs="tcp:6625:10"/>incarnate, he had neuer conceiued ſo villa nous a thought, nor beene employed in ſo damnable an action.</p>
            <p>The next day being Friday were drawn from the Tower to the olde pallace in VVeſtminſter, <hi>Thomas Winter, Rookewoode Caies</hi> and <hi>Faulkes,</hi> where <hi>Winter</hi> firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the Scaffolde, made little ſpeech, but ſeeming after a ſort as it were ſorry for his offence, and yet croſſing him ſelfe, as though thoſe were wardes to put by the Deuils Stoccadoes, hauing already made a wound in his ſoule, of which, he had not yet a full feeling, proteſting to die a true Catholicke as hee ſaid; with a very pale and dead colour went vppe the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and after a ſwing or two with a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the quartering block was drawn, and there quickliediſpatched.</p>
            <p>Next him came <hi>Ruckwood,</hi> vvho made a ſpeech of ſome longer time, confeſſing his offence to God, in ſeeking to ſhedde blood, and asking therefore mercy of his diuine Maieſtie, his offence to the King, of whoſe Maieſtie hee likevviſe humbly
<pb facs="tcp:6625:10"/>aſked forgiuenes, his offence to the whole ſtate of whome in generall he asked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe, beſeeching God to bleſſe the king, the Queene, and all his royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie, and that they might long liue to raigne in peace, and happineſſe ouer this kingdom, but laſt of all to marre all the pottage with one filthy weede to mar this good prayers with an il concluſion: he praied God to make the king a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, otherwiſe a Papiſt, which God for his mercy euer forbid: and ſo beſeeching the King to bee good to his wife and children, proteſting to die in his Idolatry, a Romiſh Catholicke, hee went vppe the ladder, and hanging till hee was almoſt dead, was drawne to the blocke, where he gaue his laſt gaſpe.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Caies,</hi> who like a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate villaine vſing little ſpeech, with ſmall or no ſhew of repentance, wente ſtoutelie vp the ladder, where not ſtaying the Hangmans turne, turned himſelfe of with ſuch a leape, that vvith the ſvving,
<pb facs="tcp:6625:11"/>he brake the Halter, but after his fall, was quicklie drawne to the blocke, and there was quicklie deuided into foure partes.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all came the great Deuill of all, <hi>Faulkes alias Iohnſon,</hi> who ſhoulde haue put fire to the powder: His body being weake with torture and ſicknes, he vvas ſcarſe able to goe vp the ladder, but yet vvith much adoe, by the helpe of the Hangman, vvent hie enough to breake his necke vvith the fall: vvho made no long ſpeech, but after a ſort, ſeeming to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for his offence, asked a kinde of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of the King, and the State, for his bloodie intent, with his croſſes &amp; his idle ceremonies, made his end vpon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and the blocke, to the great ioy of the beholders, that the land vvas ended of ſo vvicked a villanie.</p>
            <p>Thus haue <hi>I</hi> ended my diſcourſe vppon the Arraignement, and execution of theſe eight traitors executed vpon thurſdaie, and friday laſt paſt in paules church-yard
<pb facs="tcp:6625:11"/>and the old pallace at weſtminſter.</p>
            <p>Now there is certaine report of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution done on mundaie being the 27. of Ianuarie in the citie of worceſter, vpon one <hi>Perkins</hi> and his man, for the receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of traitors. God be bleſſed for it and continue the Iuſtice of law to be executed vpon all ſuch rebellious and traitorous wretches as either plot ſuch villanies, conceale ſuch treaſons, or relieue ſuch traitors, for ſince the betraying the Lord of heauen and earth, was there euer ſuch a helliſh plot practiſed in the world? if the Pope were not a verie Diuill, and theſe Ieſuites, or rather <hi>Iebuſites;</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall Semenaries,</hi> verie ſpirites of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neſſe, that whiſper in the eares of <hi>Euah</hi> to bring a world of <hi>Adams</hi> to diſtruction how could nature be ſo ſenceles or reaſon ſo graceles as to ſubiect wit ſo to wil, as to run all headlong to confuſion? is this a rule of religion? or rather of a legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the <hi>Sinagogue</hi> of Sathan ſat in counſaile for the worlds deſtruction, for the ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:6625:12"/>of a lowzie humor or bloudy deuotion, or hope of honor, or to make waie to ſome mad fury to bring the moſt floriſhing kingdome on the earth to the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the world, to kil at one blow or with one blaſt, King, Queene, Prince and Peere Biſhop, Iudge, and Magiſtrate to the ruine of the land, and vtter ſhame to the whole vvorld, and left naked to the inuaſion of anie enemie: is this a holy father that begets ſuch vvicked children? is this religion, vvhere is no touch of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? or is there anie ſparke of Grace, in theſe prieſtes? that ſo poiſon the ſoules, &amp; breake the neckes of ſo many people.</p>
            <p>Ignorance in the ſimple and Idolatrie in the ſubtil, take ceremonies for certainties ſuperſtition for religion enuie for zeale, and murther for charitie, what can that church be but hell where the diuill ſings ſuch maſſes: <hi>ſeruus ſeruorum</hi> ſaies hee that would be <hi>Dominus dominorum</hi> ſeruant of ſeruants, that would be maiſter of maiſters; is not he a cunning heards-man,
<pb facs="tcp:6625:12"/>that can make one painted cow, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bull giue him more milke, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Heard of better kine: are not theſe ſweete Notes to bee taken in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Popiſh gouernment, kill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſowe ſeditions, maintaine bawdie houſes, blinde the ſimple, abuſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, bereaue the innocent, ſweare and forſweare, ſo it be for the popes profite, the Church will abſolue you, and if you miſſe the marke to hit the miſchiefe you ſhooteat, you ſhall bee a hanging Saint, till you bee taken downe to the Deuill. Oh fine perſwaſions, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſinnes by numbred prayers, inward curſes, by outward croſſings, an offence againſt God by a pardon from man, ſhould be beleeued to be helped. A child cannot conceiue it, a wiſe man cannot diſgeſt it, and ſurely none but either blind women or mad men can beleeue it. If a man would but a little looke into their Idolatries, hee ſhould ſee a worlde of ſuch mockeries, as would make him
<pb facs="tcp:6625:13"/>both laugh at their fooleries, and abhor their villanies. Their kiſſing of babies, their kneeling to wodden Ladies, their calling to Saintes that cannot heare them, their praying by the dozen, their taking of penance, their pilgrimages to Idols, their ſhauings and their waſhings, their confeſſions and their croſſinges, and their diueliſh deuiſes to deceiue the ſimple of their comfort. Theſe with a worlde of ſuch trickes, as would make <hi>Iacke</hi> an Apes a fine Iugler: He that coulde ſee them with that cleare eye, that can iudge betwixt light and darkenes, woulde, if they were his friendes, be ſorry for them, if his enemies, laugh at them, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, or whatſoeuer leaue them, &amp; ſay as he may ſay, that <hi>Papiſtrie</hi> is meere <hi>Jdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> an incarnate Deuill, his Church a Synagogue of Satan, and his prieſtes the verie locuſtes of the earth.</p>
            <p>But let vs leaue them to their loathſome puddles, and let vs bee thankefull to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, for the cleare water of life,
<pb facs="tcp:6625:13"/>that in his holy worde, wee receiue from the fountaine of his gracious mercie, &amp; let vs a little looke into the difference betwixt the Traiterous Papiſt, that dieth for his villanie, and the faithfull Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that dyeth for the truth of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the beliefe of the worde of God.</p>
            <p>The trayterous Papiſt will pull downe princes, and ſubuert Kingdoms; murther and poyſon whome they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commaund; The faithfull prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant praieth for princes, and the peace of the people, and will endure baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hate rebellion: The proud papiſt will ſhewe intemperancie in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, while the humble proteſtant will embrace affliction with patience: The Proteſtant cries to GOD for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for his ſinnes, the Papiſt giues autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to ſinne, when before the offence the pardon is purchaſed.</p>
            <p>I ſay, was it not a ſtrange ſpeech of <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,</hi> through the blindneſſe of his bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:6625:14"/>witte, that to bring the kingdome into the popiſh Idolatrie, hee cared not to roote out all his poſteritie.</p>
            <p>Oh the miſery of theſe blinded people, forſake the true God of heauen and earth to ſubmit their ſeruice to the Deuill of the world, be Traitours to their gratious Princes to ſerue a proude vngratious pre late, looſe their lands, goods, begger their wiues and children, looſe their own liues with an open ſhame, and Ieaue an infamy to their name for euer, onely to obey the command of a cunning Foxe, that lying in his denne praieth on all the geeſe that he can light on, and in the proude beliefe to be made Saints will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their ſoules to goe to the Deuill.</p>
            <p>But how many millions hath this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill inchaunted, &amp; how many kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es hath he ruinated, and how many maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres hath he plotted, and how many ſoules hath he ſent to damnation? God for his mercy cut him off or open the eies of all them Chriſtian princes, that they
<pb facs="tcp:6625:14"/>may agree together and pull him down. For during his pride, Princes that are of his Religion, will bee but as Copieshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his Countenance, Souldiers that fight not vnder his banner, ſhall bee as ſhake-rags to his Armie; Lawyers except they pleade in his right, ſhall haue but curſes for their fees: Diuines, if not of his opinion, ſhal be excommunicate out off his Church, Merchantes that bring not him commodities ſhall keepe no ſhops, in his Sanctuarie, nor Beggars that pray not for his Monarchie, ſhall haue any almes in his Baſket: and therefore I hope, that God will ſo wipe off the skales from the eyes of the blinde, that both one and other, Souldier and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, Diuine and Laye man, rich and poore, will ſo lay their heades, their heartes and handes, and their purſes together, that where as hee hath beene long in riſing, and could not ſitte faſt, when hee was vppe, ſhall take a fall
<pb facs="tcp:6625:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ſodaine, and neuer riſe againe, when hee is downe: to which praver, <hi>I</hi> hope all true Chriſtians will ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
